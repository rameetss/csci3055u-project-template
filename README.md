## About the language

> _Scala is a high level language that utilizes both object oriented and functional programming together. It runs on existing Java platform and has similar runtime to javascript._
>
> - Scala first began in 2001 at  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne by Martin Odersky in Switzerland. This language built upon Oderskys' previous work within Java, as well as Funnel. Scalas preliminary release was in 2003, followed by a public release in 2004. A revised secondary version was released in 2006. Moving forward to 2011, the Scala team won a 5 year research grant from the European Research Council and in 2011 Odersky launched Lightbend. Lightbend is a service to help train, and support people using Scala.

> - Scala was intended to be compiled using Java, and as a result the exe code runs on Java machines
> - Because of this compatibility with Java Scala is also suitable for Android developemtn, which also is typically written in Java
> - Scala also has a javascript compiler which enables Scala to be run on web browsers

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```

## About the tools

> _Compiling a Scala program requires the Java RunTime Environment and Scala to be installed_.
> - Java can be installed through the JDK
> - Scala must be downloaded from their website
> - It is then run thorugh commands in the terminal

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _Organize your report according to the project description
document_.
