## About the language

> _Scala is a high level language that utilizes both object oriented and functional programming together. It runs on existing Java platform and has similar runtime to javascript._
>
> - Scala first began in 2001 at  École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne by Martin Odersky in Switzerland. This language built upon Oderskys' previous work within Java, as well as Funnel. Scalas preliminary release was in 2003, followed by a public release in 2004. A revised secondary version was released in 2006. Moving forward to 2011, the Scala team won a 5 year research grant from the European Research Council and in 2011 Odersky launched Lightbend. Lightbend is a service to help train, and support people using Scala.

> - Scala was intended to be compiled using Java, and as a result the exe code runs on Java machines
> - Because of this compatibility with Java Scala is also suitable for Android development, which also is typically written in Java
> - Scala also has a javascript compiler which enables Scala to be run on web browsers

## About the syntax

> _Here are some snippets of common programs run on devices_

*Hello World*

```Scala
object Main extends App {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```
> _From this snippet we can see that there are no semi colons at the end of each line like c++_
> _It has a similar structure to Javascript_

*Hello World*

```Scala
object Main extends App {

  //Define variables and values here
  val greeting = "Hello everyone!"
  val Greeting = "See, grammar is important"
  
  //output the variables
  println(greeting)
  println(Greeting)
}
```
> _Scala is case sensitive so we can see here that the variable greeting is different than Greeting._
> _Comments in scala utilize // as we can see 2 coments have been inserted into the code._

*Hello World*

```Scala
object Main extends App {
class MyFirstProgram{
def myFirstMethod(args: Array[String]){
  val greeting = "Hello everyone!"
  val Greeting = "See, grammar is important"
  println(greeting)
  println(Greeting)
    }
  }
}
```
> _Class names should also start with a capital letter such as: "MyFirstProgram"_
> _Function names should begin with a lower case such as: "myFirstProgram"_

## About the tools

> _Compiling a Scala program requires the Java RunTime Environment and Scala to be installed_.
> - Java can be installed through the JDK
> - Scala must be downloaded from their website
> - It is then run thorugh commands in the terminal

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _Organize your report according to the project description
document_.
